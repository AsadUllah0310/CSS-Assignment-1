        Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature, New Scientist, </i>and all the other<br/>
        scientific journal her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <i> On The Road.</i> It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she<br/>
        spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.

        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that "Work is the refuge of people who have<br/> 
        nothing better to do". Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the IIama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement. Molly<br/>
        <i> did</i> think she had something better to do.
